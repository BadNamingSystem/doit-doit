Concise Application Data Flow Summary

1. Central State (App.tsx):
◦ The App component holds the main todos array in its state.
◦ It also manages auxiliary UI states like showAddTodo (to display the form) and todoToEdit (to track which item is being edited).
◦ All core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) logic (addTodo, deleteTodo, updateTodo, startEdit) resides here.

2. Data Down, Actions Up (Props & Callbacks):
◦ Data Down: The App passes the todos array and the todoToEdit object (as isEditing) down to its child components (TodoList and FormAddTodo) via props.
◦ Actions Up: Child components don't modify the state directly. Instead, they receive callback functions (like addTodo, deleteTodo, updateTodo, startEdit, onClose) as props.
  When a user interacts with a child component (e.g., clicks a button, submits a form), the child calls the appropriate callback function, passing any necessary
  data back up to the App component.

3. Persistence (useEffect):
◦ A useEffect hook in App.tsx automatically saves the entire todos array to localStorage whenever it changes, ensuring your data persists across browser sessions.
  It also safely loads data on initial app startup.

4. Editing Flow (Key Interaction):
◦ When you click "Edit" on a TodoItem, the startEdit callback sends the specific to-do object up to App.
◦ App stores this to-do in todoToEdit and shows the FormAddTodo.
◦ FormAddTodo receives todoToEdit (as isEditing), pre-fills its fields, and changes its button text to "Update".
◦ When you submit the form, it calls updateTodo (if isEditing is present) or addTodo (if not), sending the modified data back to App.
◦ App updates the todos state, and the form calls onClose to hide itself and reset todoToEdit.
